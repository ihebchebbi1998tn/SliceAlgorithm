## 📷 Overview

The **Image Slicing Algorithm** is a powerful and efficient way to render images in smaller segments, improving performance for web applications built with React. By slicing images into smaller pieces, we can optimize loading times and resource management, making this approach ideal for image-heavy applications.

## ✨ Features

- **Dynamic Image Slicing**: Split images into configurable slices for efficient rendering.
- **Flexible Dimensions**: Customize slice width and height according to your needs.
- **React Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with React applications.
- **Responsive Design**: Automatically adjusts to various screen sizes and layouts.
